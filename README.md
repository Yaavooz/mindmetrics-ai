# mindmetrics-ai
an interactive web app that predicts a user’s emotional well-being score (0–100) from a short questionnaire about their daily habits, mood, and lifestyle patterns. The model is trained on clinically validated psychological datasets (like PHQ-9, GAD-7, and WHO-5), and uses Explainable AI to show which factors most affect the prediction.
